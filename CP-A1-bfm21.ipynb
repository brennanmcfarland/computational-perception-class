Assume again Gaussian noise, $y(t) \\sim N(0, \\sigma_n)$, and for simplicity, that $t$ is discrete and the measured samples $y(t)$ are independent.  The signal $x(t)$, however, only arrives at random intervals and is zero elsewhere.  Events that arrive at random, independent invervals obey Poisson statistics, and the interval can be modeled with an exponential distribution.\n",
